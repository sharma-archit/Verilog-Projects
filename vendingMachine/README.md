# Vending Machine

This is a design of a vending machine that sells phone cases ($10) and wireless earbuds ($15) and only takes $5, $10, $20, and $50 bills. It dispenses the product after the money has been input (specifically after the input when no more money is being inserted) and returns change - if any - with the product being dispensed.
